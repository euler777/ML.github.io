## Welcome to Machine Learning in Python and R!

Throughout these tutorials we present practical machine learning algorithms that are commonplace and form the foundations for continued research. Each section contains implementation details in Python and R and explains their use in extracting information to make decisions in different contexts.

# What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the application and science of algorithms that make sense of data; in short, these algorithms `give computers the ability to learn from data` and using practical self-learning algorithms we can turn data into knowledge and grant you the ability to spot patterns in data and make predictions about future events.
